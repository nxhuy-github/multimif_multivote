# STREAM FILE
# This file is called when database must be deployed (for production purpose)
# How to trigger it:
#	java -jar StreamStim/streamstim-1.0.jar -f StreamStim/test.stream

# define a prefix to easely locate sql files
@prefix = "/home/daratrix/Documents/MULTIMIF_F_Vote/src/main/sql"
print "TODO : change the prefix !"

# We open a SQL connection to the H2 database.
# !!! Check the infos (driver, connection, username, password)
# !!! password can be (and should be) an environment variable
open sql connection "org.h2.Driver" "jdbc:h2:~/test3" "test" "test" #comment
print "TODO : correct test database identifiers !"

# We may want to clear the database before creating the tables.

# We call the script to create the tables
call stream file "StreamStim/sqlTables.stream" 

# We call the script to add the constraints
call stream file "StreamStim/sqlConstraints.stream"

# We call the script to add the test data
call stream file "StreamStim/sqlTest.stream"

# We close the SQL connection
close sql connection # comment
